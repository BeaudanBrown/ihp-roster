# Roster Weeks Specification

This file describes implemented roster-week behavior. Future roster-group,
pilot, or payroll prediction work belongs in `docs/workstreams/` until it
lands.

## Current Contract

- `weekOffset` in the URL is the source of truth for the viewed week.
- `RosterWeeksAction` resets to the current week.
- `ShowRosterWeekAction { weekOffset }` is the canonical explicit week route.
- HTMX week navigation swaps the stable roster shell and pushes canonical URLs.
- Missing weeks may be materialized when an authenticated venue member visits
  them; staff see hidden/unpublished draft shells when appropriate.
- Staff users cannot edit unpublished roster weeks.
- Managers, venue admins, venue owners, and support-mode super admins can use
  manager/admin roster controls according to the controller capability checks.
- Admin-and-up users see compact week wage estimate totals in roster chrome
  only when roster end times are enabled for the venue: the week total in the
  toolbar and per-day totals in day labels or day-column headers. Managers,
  staff, and venues without roster end times enabled do not receive wage
  estimate controls or markup.
- Publishing a roster is the visibility gate for staff-facing roster content.
- Publishing requires every staffed shift to have a start time and shift type;
  venues with end times enabled must also provide an end time.
- Publishing an auto-timesheet-enabled roster queues `roster_timesheet_creation`
  app jobs for complete slots using the slot state and calculated run time at
  the moment of publishing.
- Moving a live roster week back to draft cancels that week's not-started and
  retry `roster_timesheet_creation` jobs by marking them succeeded with result
  `{status: "cancelled", reason: "roster_week_moved_to_draft"}`. Running jobs
  are not force-cancelled; they rely on their execution-time live-week checks and
  may remain active until the worker finishes them.
- Republishing after draft edits creates fresh roster-timesheet jobs from the
  current complete slot state and recalculated run times after older active jobs
  for those slots have been cancelled or finished.
- Roster forms must submit full cell payloads so single-field edits do not
  clear sibling slot fields.

## Scheduling Data

- Roster weeks are venue-scoped and may be roster-group-scoped as the group
  model lands.
- Roster days group slots by day offset.
- Roster days store their visible open-day row count independently of slots.
- Roster slots are sparse positioned data records. Blank editable cells are
  rendered from the day row count and active slot definitions; active blank
  slots should not be stored.
- Slot rows use `row_index` to align early/mid/late-style visual rows in the
  default table layout.
- Day-column layout renders actual slots compactly in column-major order,
  sorted top-to-bottom by start time within each day, and ignores holes in the
  default table layout.
- Day-column draft/editable and live/read-only cards use the same compact shift
  type badge shape. Editable badges remain select controls; read-only badges do
  not present interactive affordance.
- Shift type badges show the assigned shift type name. Shift types with a
  palette colour key render a small persisted colour marker; blank colour keys
  render without a colour highlight. Unassigned shifts show `Type`; staffed
  shifts without a shift type show `Type required` with warning/dashed styling.
- Slot names and shift types are venue configuration, not free-form authority.
- Shift type colour keys are optional reusable labels. Blank (`''`) means no
  roster colour highlight; palette keys (`palette-1` through `palette-10`) opt a
  shift type into highlighting. Multiple shift types may share the same palette
  key.
- Admin shift type configuration exposes the optional colour directly. New shift
  types default to blank, so using colours is an opt-in highlighting workflow.

## Standard Grid Rules

- Standard day-row layout preserves clear day boundaries across the whole grid:
  each day section ends with a strong separator, and the first row of each next
  day gets a strong top border across all slot cells.
- Standard day-row shift type cells retain the existing cell format; shift type
  colour may be used only as a subtle internal accent and must not override
  conflict or issue highlighting.

## Conflict And Availability Rules

- Late-to-early conflict uses start-to-start gap.
- The threshold is venue-level configuration.
- Staff shift preferences are recurring weekday availability windows; the current schema enforces one active row per staff member and weekday, and conflict evaluation treats multiple supplied same-day windows as matching when any window contains the rostered start time.
- Leave/unavailability conflicts affect roster availability according to the
  approved-state rules in the leave subsystem.

## Live Updates

- The roster shell stays subscribed even when a week is empty or hidden so
  create/copy/publish transitions can update passive viewers.
- Actor browser responses return HTMX fragments or OOB swaps.
- Passive viewers receive websocket invalidations with structural fragment refs.
- Fragment GET routes must enforce the same venue/visibility rules as the full
  page.
- Roster live fragments refresh immediately; discrete autosaved controls should
  commit on change instead of relying on blur-deferred protection.
- `#roster-content` owns only the main roster column, header, and grid. It does
  not render `#roster-staff-panel-fragment`.
- `#roster-staff-panel-fragment` is a sibling side-panel fragment. Broad roster
  week refreshes may request content and staff panel together because their
  containment paths are siblings.
- Day and row fragments remain descendants of `#roster-content`; when a parent
  content refresh is selected, actor/passive planning drops overlapping day or
  row refs.

## Extension Rules

- Do not store last-viewed week in the database without a new product decision.
- Do not add feature-specific JavaScript for generic live-surface behavior.
- If a mutation fans out across many possible weeks, intersect with active live
  subscriptions before querying cold historical scopes.
- Preserve stable DOM ids from `Web/RosterWeeks/Dom.hs` when changing views or
  responses.

## Verification

Use focused checks for roster work:

```bash
bash ./bin/in-env typecheck
bash ./bin/in-env hspec-test --match "RosterWeeks"
bash ./bin/in-env e2e e2e/roster-live-fragments.spec.ts
bash ./bin/in-env e2e e2e/roster-mobile.spec.ts
```
